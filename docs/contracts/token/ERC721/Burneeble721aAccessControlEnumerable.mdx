## BurneebleERC721A Contract Documentation

The `BurneebleERC721A` contract is a Solidity contract designed to manage the creation and management of NFT collections. Each NFT in this collection has specific properties, including a base URI, a preview URI, an issuance price, and issuance quantity limits. This documentation provides an overview of the contract, its primary features, and the permissions required for its use.

### Overview

The `BurneebleERC721A` contract allows for the creation and management of NFT collections. Each NFT has distinct attributes, such as a base URI, a preview URI, an issuance price, and limitations on the quantity that can be issued. This contract offers the flexibility for the owner to update collection settings and oversee NFT issuance.

### Key Features

#### Constructor

- The contract is created with a constructor that requires the following parameters:
  - `_tokenName`: The name of the NFT collection.
  - `_tokenSymbol`: The symbol of the NFT collection.
  - `_maxSupply`: The maximum number of NFTs that can be issued within this collection.
  - `_mintPrice`: The price for each NFT issued, denominated in wei.

#### Roles and Permissions

The contract employs a role-based permission system, with two primary roles:

- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Assigned to the contract owner.
- `ADMIN_ROLE`: Assigned to collection administrators.

The owner (holder of `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`) has full control over the collection and can assign or revoke the administrator role to other users.

### Settings Update

The owner (holder of `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`) can update various collection settings:

- `baseUri`: The base URI for generating NFT URIs.
- `uriSuffix`: The suffix to append to NFT URIs.
- `revealed`: Indicates whether the collection has been revealed.
- `paused`: Toggles the contract's pause state.
- `preRevealUri`: The URI used for NFTs before their revelation.
- `mintPrice`: The issuance price of an NFT.
- `maxMintAmountPerTrx`: The maximum number of NFTs issued per transaction.
- `maxMintAmountPerAddress`: The maximum number of NFTs an address can issue.

### Owner Management

The owner (holder of `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`) can:

- Transfer ownership of the contract to a new address.
- Assign the administrator role (`ADMIN_ROLE`) to other users.
- Revoke the administrator role from users.

### NFT Issuance

- Users can issue new NFTs through the `mint` function. Controls ensure that the maximum issuance limit is not exceeded and that sufficient funds are provided for payment.

### Additional Functions

- The contract supports interfaces, such as the `IBurneebleERC721A` interface.
- NFT information, including URIs, can be retrieved using the `tokenURI` function.

## Permissions

The contract uses a role-based permission system, and permissions are assigned based on roles:

- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Assigned to the contract owner.
- `ADMIN_ROLE`: Assigned to collection administrators.

Specific permissions are required to perform certain actions:

- `requireOwner`: Needed for actions requiring `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, such as changing contract ownership.
- `requireAdmin`: Needed for actions requiring `ADMIN_ROLE`, such as updating collection settings.
- `active`: Required for actions when the contract is not paused.
- `canMint`: Required for issuing new NFTs, ensuring issuance limits are not exceeded.
- `enoughFunds`: Necessary for issuing new NFTs, ensuring sufficient funds for payment.
